My name is Lawrence Lin and I am currently a M.S. Data Science candidate @ the University of San Francisco. You can list my current resume with my detailed work history and accomplishments [here](https://github.com/lawrencedlin/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf). My favorite data visualizations are from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethiryeight.com) and the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com).

I hope you can get a better understanding of my projects here. I've curated some my favorite projects through the years.
