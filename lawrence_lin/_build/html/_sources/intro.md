Master's student in Data Science at the University of San Francisco. I have a background in statistics and experience using data science to solve problems in academic contexts. I am currently learning postgreSQL, natural language processing (NLP), and computer networking. I am passionate about the potential of applying artificial intelligence at scale.My name is Lawrence Lin and I am currently a M.S. Data Science candidate @ the University of San Francisco. My favorite data visualizations are from https://fivethiryeight.com and the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com).

On this website, I have highlighted some of my favorite projects spanning my undergraduate and graduate years.
