# An Introduction

My names is Lawrence Lin and I am currently a M.S. Data Science candidate @ the University of San Francisco. My interests are in sentiment analysis and computer vision. My favorite data visualizations are from fivethiryeight.com and the Wall Street Journal

On this website, I have highlighted some of my favorite projects spanning my undergraduate and graduate years.
